    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Christian Eric O. Amoro, and I’m 18 years old from Basak, Lapu-Lapu City.  
      I grew up in a simple and loving family that taught me the importance of respect, kindness, and hard work.  
      I’m currently studying at Lapu-Lapu City College, taking up BS in Industrial Technology (BINDTECH), major in Computer Technology.  
      My school experience has been full of learning, friendship, and challenges that help me grow as a student and as a person.

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
      I love playing basketball, listening to music, and spending time with my friends.  
      These hobbies help me relax and enjoy life even when things get stressful.  
      One challenge I’ve faced is balancing my studies and personal life, but it taught me to manage my time and stay focused on my goals.
